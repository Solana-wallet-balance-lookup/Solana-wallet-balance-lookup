## Quick Start

Get up and running quickly:

*   Download the latest compiled version from the [Release](../../releases) section.
*   Build the project yourself to tailor the features or resolve particular needs.

## Project Building Guide

The project can be built using Visual Studio or any other C++ compiler. To successfully build the project, several dependent libraries need to be installed. **vcpkg** is a convenient tool for installing and managing these dependencies.

### Installing Dependencies Using vcpkg:

1. If you donâ€™t have **vcpkg** yet, clone the repository and install it by following the instructions on the [official page](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg).

2. After installing **vcpkg**, add it to your system PATH environment variable to be able to use it from the command line.

3. To install the dependencies, run the following commands:

   - Install **OpenSSL**:
     ```bash
     vcpkg install openssl
     ```

   - Install **nlohmann-json**:
     ```bash
     vcpkg install nlohmann-json
     ```

   - Install **Crypto++**:
     ```bash
     vcpkg install cryptopp
     ```

   - Install **libsodium**:
     ```bash
     vcpkg install libsodium
     ```

4. Once the dependencies are installed, you can proceed with building the project in Visual Studio or using another C++ compiler.

### Building via Visual Studio:

1. Open the project solution in Visual Studio.
2. Make sure **vcpkg** is correctly integrated with your environment. You can follow the instructions for [integrating vcpkg with Visual Studio](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg#visual-studio).
3. Click **Build** -> **Build Solution**.
4. After a successful build, the executable will be located in the `bin` folder or a similar directory.

### Building with Another C++ Compiler:

1. Ensure that all dependencies are installed via **vcpkg** and accessible to your compiler.
2. Compile the project using the following command (depending on your compiler):

   ```bash
   g++ -o solanachecker main.cpp -lssl -lcrypto -lsodium -lcryptopp -std=c++17
   ```

## Command Line Options

Use command-line arguments to maximize flexibility:

1.  **-s / -search**: Run a brute-force search for wallets that have Solana balances by generating seed phrases.

2.  **-t / -track (ADDRESS)**: Start tracking activity on a specific Solana address, get instant monitoring.

3.  **-g / -gen (NUMBER)**: Create a specified number of new Solana wallets (e.g., `-g 25` generates 25 wallets).

4.  **-m / -mnemonic (MNEMONIC)**: Display wallet info using a seed phrase (e.g., `-m "your seed phrase"`).

5.  **-b / -balance (ADDRESS)**: Directly check the SOL balance of a provided address (e.g., `-b YourSolanaAddressHere`).
